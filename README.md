# log-analyzer

This script uses Python's re module to perform regular expression matching on each line of the log file. 

The regular expression used in this example assumes that the log file contains lines with the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS IP_ADDRESS MESSAGE. 

The analyze_log function reads the log file line by line and uses the regular expression to extract the date, time, IP address, and message from each line. It then prints the extracted information.

This script is a simple example and does not include error handling for invalid user input or other potential issues. 

It also does not include any advanced features such as filtering log lines based on certain criteria or generating summary statistics from the log data. However, it should serve as a good starting point for a log analyzer project.

Please note that log files can be very large, so processing them efficiently can be a challenge. 

This script reads the log file line by line, which is a good approach for handling large files. 

However, if you need to perform more complex analysis on the log data, you may want to consider using a more advanced tool or library for log processing.
